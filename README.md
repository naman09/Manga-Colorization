# Manga-Colorization
To run the frontend:
	npx create-react-app needs t be executed in the working directory
	The models need to be stored in the same folder as the code
	Link to download the trained models: www.kaggle.com/dataset/d4ca7e40d3d23e07ee3ceeee8a22c044c22efd45140fb70e2277621ac97e5497
	Once the weights have been downloaded and stored, the frontend could be used to import the input images(selection of multiple sketches/images is possible)
	The images would then be processed and the final output will be saved on the local machine as well as displayed on the browser
